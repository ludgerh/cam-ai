obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any
such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the
same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does
not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to
information about these recipients.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Cantarell"><span lang="en-US">Likewise, under
Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the
controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6

<h5 class="western"><strong><font face="Cantarell"><span lang="en-US">Customer
account/registration</span></font></strong></h5>
<p lang="en-US"><font face="Cantarell">You have the possibility to
register on the website of the controller with the indication of
personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller
is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration.
The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and
stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his
own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more
processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for
an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US"><font face="Cantarell">By registering on the website
of the controller, the IP address—assigned by the Internet service
provider (ISP) and used by the data subject—date, and time of the
registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place
against the background that this is the only way to prevent the
misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to
investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is
necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to
third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the
data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US"><font face="Cantarell">The registration of the data
subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended
to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or
services that may only be offered to registered users due to the
nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to
change the personal data specified during the registration at any
time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the
controller (the user name cannot be changed).</font></p>
<p lang="en-US"><font face="Cantarell">The controller shall, at any
time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to
what personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition,
the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the
request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no
statutory storage obligations. The entirety of the controller’s
team are available to the data subject in this respect as contact
persons.</font></p>

us. We also store the IP address of your computer and the date and
time of your registration. During the registration process, we will
obtain your consent to receive this newsletter and the type of

is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any

data</span></font></strong></h5>
<p lang="en-US"><font face="Cantarell">For technical reasons, the

<p lang="en-US"><font face="Cantarell">The legal basis for this is
Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest of the
provider is to improve the quality of use of the website.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US"><font face="Cantarell">The plugins are integrated via
a linked graphic. The user is only forwarded to the service of the
respective social media by clicking on the corresponding graphic.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US"><font face="Cantarell">After the customer has been
forwarded, information about the user is recorded by the respective
social media. This is initially data such as IP address, date, time
and page visited. If the user is logged into his/her user account of
the respective social media at the same time, the social media
operator can, if required, assign the information collected from the
user’s specific visit to the user’s personal account. If the user
interacts via a “Share” button of the respective social media,
this information can be stored in the user’s personal user account
and, if required, be published. If the user wants to prevent the
collected information from being directly assigned to his/her user
account, the user must log out before clicking on the graphic. It is
also possible to configure the respective user account accordingly.</font></p>
